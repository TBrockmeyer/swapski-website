Steps to customize your own website, built with Joomla! templates, modules and extensions

1) Install a template and modules that suit your objectives, e.g.
- the [AS Joomla Hotel Booking Template|https://www.astemplates.com/free-joomla-template/944-et-hotel-booking]
- the [The J-HotelReservation Starter|https://www.cmsjunkie.com/joomla_hotel_reservation_starter]

2) Adapt the website, e.g.
- by including modules in articles and content you write in your Content Management System interface, by citing them with
{loadmodule mod_#yourmodulename#}, here: {loadmodule mod_jhotelreservation}
- by altering the content in the language files of your module BEFORE (re-)installing the module.
E.g., in the ZIP file of your module, go to '...\jhotelreservation_starter_v6.0.7_j3\admin\language\en-GB', make a safety copy of the config file 'en-GB.com_jhotelreservation' and then alter the original file with content according to your needs.
